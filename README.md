# PopulateMixSpace

This project contains MATLAB scripts to accompany the paper "Populating the mix space: parametric methods for generating multitrack audio mixtures", submitted to Applied Sciences, Special Issue "Sound and Music Computing".

The script "Example1.m" can be used to generate a dataset of music mixes. The SphericalDistributionsRand routines are required (available from https://github.com/yuhuichen1015/SphericalDistributionsRand). Otherwise, no installation is required. Test audio is provided in the subfolder "Audio".
